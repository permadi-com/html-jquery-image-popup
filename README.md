This is a relatively simple image "lightbox" popup implementation, using html, jQuery and css.

How to Use
1. Include <b>image-modal.js</b> and <b>image-modal.css</b>. Note: jQuery use is assumed, otherwise you need to include it.
2. Add <b>image-popup</b> class to the images that you want the lightbox enabled.
3. Replace the images inside the images folder if you don't want to use the defaults.
